This recipe started with this all recipes recipe that Chastity shared with me:

https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/10813/best-chocolate-chip-cookies/

With some modifications. Basically, I did the following:

* water and baking soda with sifting baking powder in with the flour
* brown sugar with honey (basically a tbsp of whipped honey)
* I refrigerated the dough so its cold when it goes in the oven
* No nuts
* chopped up semi-sweet baking chocolate bars instead of a bag of chips

I think overall they turned out well but I think they are slightly too cakey for my tastes and i would use half a cup less flour to make them more cookie like.
