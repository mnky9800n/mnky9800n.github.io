*Dangal* tells the story of Mahavir Singh Phogat and his two wrestler daughters. It starts with the sort of moral air of a kung fu film about the boxers revolution era as it introduces Mahavir Singh Phogat. Mahavir wishes for a son but is only granted daughters who he begins training to wrestle when he realizes they can fight. The movie chronicles the story of Mahavir but also his daughter Geeta as she goes to the Commonwealth Games. It is based on a true story.

This movie was fucking fantastic as a sports film. Every bout you are on the edge of your seat waiting. Additionally, the strong women's equality message is welcome in this story. Geeta fights not just for herself but for all the women of India. I highly recommend this movie.
