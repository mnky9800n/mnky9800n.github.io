This movie was fantastic. The director uses camera movement as an allegory for the expressive brush strokes of Van Gogh himself. The internal dialogue that Van Gogh goes through shows a clear understanding of how anxiety works and how to communicate Van Gogh's anxiety of life. This movie told a slice of Van Gogh's life, but also discussed the difficulty of dealing with mental illness. Anxiety, misunderstandings, fluctuating emotions, this movie made a serious comment on the difficulty of dealing with such problems. I highly recommend this movie.
