Hackers is a movie that is very close to my heart. I have run many parties build around this movie, even harassing Loyd Blankenship, author of *The Hacker Manifesto*, because his book is quoted in the movie. Thus it makes sense I would do one more party on it for the new Njord Watches series I decided to host at University of Oslo Njord Centre. As part of this event I promised to give a talk prior to the movie giving it some context. This talk can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TKXyaypsgUYCIpiLtHszELQDGfY8MM-CPfW1lCJhI_I/edit?usp=sharing). Enjoy!
