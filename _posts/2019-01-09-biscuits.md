This recipe is easy and I stole it from Chastity who found it online. You can make them in 30 minutes.

Ingredients

* 2 cups of flour - i use a normal sized coffee cup
* 6 tbsp of butter, cold - i eye ball this
* 1 cup of milk - use the same coffee cup
* 3 tsp of baking powder
* grated cheddar - use a lot but don't over do it
* salt - i do 9-10 turns on the shaker

1. mix all the dry stuff,
2. cut in the butter
3. add cheese and milk, mix up
4. once its mixed pull it out and fold it over a few times so its layered when it bakes and it puffs out nicely
5. roll it out so its like as thick as your finger, i just push it out with my hands tbh
6. cut out biscuits with the coffee cup from before
7. bake at 225C until the tops are brown

These keep pretty well, you can pop them in the microwave and reheat and they are really nice.
