This movie was fantastic. The sound design is on point. There is a great scene at the beginning where Ikarus has taken ketamine and the sound is what he is hearing but the scene is shot in such a way that you see it from his girl friend's point of view. So you get the disorientation of the ketamine and her disappointment. Overall I really enjoyed this film, it's commentary on mental healthcare, medication, and of course the phenomenal sound track. Highly recommended.
