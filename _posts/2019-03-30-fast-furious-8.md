This movie is terrible. It's a generic action vehicle of the current generation of action shit that uses name recognition of the fast and furious franchise and actors to generate ticket sales. Charlize Theron is horribly cast, her wardrobe is a terrible rip off of Angelina Jolie circa *Gone in 60 Seconds*, and she is inexplicably given terrible Bond-villian like pseudo-intellectual monologues.

What's even more insulting is how this movie shoehorn's in a "family" plot because of the first movie where Vin Diesel makes a big point of sticking wtih family. Like they give him a secret baby with a secret wife as some plot device to force Vin Diesel to do bad things for Charlize Theron then halfway through the movie they realize Vin Diesels original GF is still in this movie so they kill the secret wife to tie up lose ends.

I'm left with three points:

1. Just skip to the prison escape sequence because its actually fun to watch
2. I'm glad Ludacris is still getting work
3. How did we get from street racing and robbing truck drivers to this?

One bonus point, the set of the rooftop at the end of the movie in NYC is as believeable as a rooftop set in the show *Friends*.

This movie is why people take their phones out in the theater.
