This is a recipe for chili that I title "Meat Soup" because that's what my swedish roommate called it after being told repeatedly it was called chili. This chili is heavy on vegetables and light on beans because I'm not a big fan of lots of beans in chili. Also, shit like broccoli and cauliflour really makes the dish a lot meatier than any legume ever would.

## Ingredients
* tomatoes
* tomato paste
* oil
* meat
* vegetables
* spices
* legumes
* some sort of stock

There are three major components.

1. The Sauce
2. The meat
3. The vegetables and legumes

## The Sauce

Saute chopped tomatoes in oil until they are reduced. they should be able to mush up easily. While you are waiting for this you can create the basic spices combination. I recommend Black Pepper, cayenne, paprika, salt, some sort of sweet thing (the picture used honey but you can use maple syrup or sugar or whatever.). Think about where the spices show up in your mouth, some are hot in the back, some in the front, thats how you make a full flavor. At least thats my theory anyways. Use a lot, the more the merrier. When the tomatoes have reduced enough you can add the spices and the tomato paste and that will turn into something nice. Make sure you don't burn it.

## The meat

You can use whatever you want. I normally use like ground beef or lamb. Personally I think its unethical to eat meat because really as the smartest beings on the planet we should probably put our energy into conserving the environment for the other beings we share the planet with but whatever, nobody cares. Anyways, brown it and set it aside.

## The vegetables and legumes

You should always have onions and pepper/paprika for the flavor but other than that you can use whatever you want. We used kidney beans but I actually prefer black. Also corn, cauliflour, broccoli, probably some other stuff.

Put all this stuff in the pot and cook it in a little oil (or just use the fat from the meat you just browned).

## Combination

Basically at this point, everything should be ready to be combined. THe vegetables are probably cooking in the pot well enough and the sauce should be ready. Put everything in the pot all together. Add your stock so that it basically covers it. I suppose you could also use a beer, I imagine a lager would be good but not a stout. But don't blame me if it doesn't work. Anyways, bring to boil and let it simmer for like an hour and you will have delicous chili.

Make sure you taste it to make sure the spices are right. You can always add more, but the earlier the better.
