These are historically called sausage balls because they use sausage but you can use any old ground meat and spice it yourself.

## Ingredients

* ground meat
* flour
* butter
* salt
* baking powder
* various cheeses
* Spices

For every 0.5kg of meat you should have 2 cups of flour, 1 tsp of baking powder, 1 tsp of salt, and 5 tbsp of butter, and 0.5kg of grated cheese.

I feel like I always don't use enough spices but basically, use stuff that will make it spicy (e.g., Cayenne, paprika, black pepper).

Mix everything until you get basically a giant ball of "dough" and then cut it into balls and put on a baking sheet with some paper and cook it at 175C for 20-25 minutes or so.
