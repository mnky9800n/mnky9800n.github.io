**IMDB ranking: i dont care**

I spent most of this movie thinking tom hardy was christian bale.

*The Revenant* is like Cormack McCarthy's *The Road* but it takes place in 1820 instead of the future. It will suck the life out of you. It's technically beautiful in the way Ang Lee's *Brokeback Mountain* is technically beautiful, but it lacks any character to identify with. The movie is good but it really spends a lot of time reminding you it's a movie that was technically difficult to make.

I recommend seeing this if you can appreciate that it uses all natural lighting, Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't spend a lot of time talking just breathing, and Tom Hardy is a fucking chameleon.

edit: I didn't post the trailer because the trailer tells you the entire fucking movie. Going into this movie without seeing the trailer makes it better.
