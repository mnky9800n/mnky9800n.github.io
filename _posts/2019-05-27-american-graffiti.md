Yesterday I watched the two progenitors of the modern college/teen movie: American graffiti and animal House. American graffiti is almost a thought piece. It examines the draw of home and the success provided by leaving and the desires and comfortableness of what is known. It's a tragedy almost except that Richard Dreyfus escapes. Animal House, while a modern interpretation might paint it as offensive and problematic, examines race and gender relations from a dominant white male perspective. It also lacks a coherent narrative. Both movies established the tropes we see in today's teen and college movies. A single night of life, examining how sex affects the sense we make of relationships, male dominance of young peoples interactions and expectations. 

All this being said, if you only choose one to watch, choose American graffiti. It's legitimately good. Probably George Lucas' best film story and dialogue and atmosphere wise. At least without the need for special effects.
