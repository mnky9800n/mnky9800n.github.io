# Hi it's me

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/POQODZA.jpg" width="250" />

I am a computational scientist interested in geophysics, glaciology, and computational social science. My work focuses on applying machine learning and data science techniques to understanding problems in these spaces. My work has included building statistical models of rock fracturing in laboratory settings, image segmentation of core samples, classifying surge-type glaciers, understanding the effects that predict when students graduate, unpacking how students use video lectures, and building large data sets both from passive data sets like student information systems and actively collected data such as surveys. My passions include reading, movies (I should have finished film school), and databases.
Most of the stuff that happens here is related to hobbies and random stuff I do.
