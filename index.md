# Hi it's me

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/POQODZA.jpg" width="250" />

I am a computational scientist interested in the dynamics of social systems typically in education. My work has included understanding the effects that predict when students graduate, unpacking how students use video lectures, and building large data sets both from passive data sets like student information systems and actively collected data such as surveys. I have a PhD This is my page. I am a PhD student in physics pretending to do data science. My passions include reading, movies (I should have finished film school), and databases.

Most of the stuff that happens here is related to hobbies and random stuff I do. 

If you want my professional page find me on [google scholar](https://scholar.google.no/citations?user=OFBaoZEAAAAJ&hl=en).
