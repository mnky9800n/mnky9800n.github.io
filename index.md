# Hi it's me

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/POQODZA.jpg" width="250" />

This is my page. I am a PhD student in physics pretending to do data science. My passions include reading, movies (I should have finished film school), and databases.

Most of the stuff that happens here is related to hobbies and random stuff I do. If you want my professional page find me on [google scholar](https://scholar.google.no/citations?user=OFBaoZEAAAAJ&hl=en) or just go to [johnmaiken.com](http://johnmaiken.com).
