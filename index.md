I am a research scientist who focuses on using python to do things that appear as science. I work at <a href="https://expertanalytics.no">Expert Analytics</a> and the University of Oslo Njord Centre. My research mostly focuses on applying some kind of computational science to some kind of computable data. This mostly is connected to things related to what I loosely define as geophysics. I have previously worked on educational research topics using computational science. These works include predicting fracture development in laboratory experiments, investigating instabilities on glaciers, image analysis of rock core samples to assess CO2 injection sites, detecting cracking events due to fluid motion, and predicting university student decision making. My passions include reading, movies (I should have finished film school), and databases. Most of the stuff that happens here is related to hobbies and random stuff I do. If you want my professional page find me on <a href="https://scholar.google.no/citations?user=OFBaoZEAAAAJ&hl=en">[google scholar]</a>.
