# Hi it's me

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/POQODZA.jpg" width="250" />

I am a research scientist who likes to work on integrating ML within the problem spaces of geophysics, glaciology, and social science. These works include predicting fracture development in laboratory experiments, investigating instabilities on glaciers, image analysis of rock core samples to assess CO2 injection sites, and predicting university student decision making. My passions include reading, movies (I should have finished film school), and databases. I also enjoy rock climbing and endeavor to do so poorly wherever I go.

Most of the stuff that happens here is related to hobbies and random stuff I do. 

If you want my professional page find me on [google scholar](https://scholar.google.no/citations?user=OFBaoZEAAAAJ&hl=en).
